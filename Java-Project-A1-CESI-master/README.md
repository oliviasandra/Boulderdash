# Boulder Dash – Group 5 - 2019

Our Java Project consisted of reproducing an abandonware named Boulder Dash, in Java. A one player based 2D video game in which the main character has to collect diamonds to succeed levels.
You can have an idea of what the game consists in by visiting https://www.retrogames.cz/play_232-NES.php.

### Prerequisites :

-    Knowledge about the [Java language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
-    [UML Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)
-    [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/documentation/) IDE + Maven / Junit / Github
-    [Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

## Rules :

- Use of MVC architecture, Observer, Strategy and Singleton design patterns
- Pre-configured maven project with different modules we can use : Controller / Entity / Model / View / Contract / Main
- Use of Swing graphic framework only
- Store game’s levels in a database

## Outcomes : 

- Produce JUnit tests for our code
- Reports to produce : JXR / Surefire / Github use
- Diagrams to realize : Components / Packages / Classes / Sequence
- Create a Javadoc (website with specific comments), that includes our tests
- Modelize the CMD of our database

### Installation :

To play our game, while having all our code, you will have to download the multiple files of this subject. To do this you can either download each file or enter this in your terminal :
  
```
git clone <https://github.com/AntoineChvl/JPU-BlankProject.git>
```

Then, load the SQL script you downloaded right before in PhpMyAdmin. Start Eclipse and go into the “main” search for the *main.java* class. Run.

However, if you don’t want to have all the code, you just have to download the .jar file in the /target/ directory and load the SQL script into PhpMyAdmin.


## Running the tests :

If you want to try some JUnit tests you can go to the corresponding file and run it. Obviously you can modify the value to search for success and failure. For the list of all available tests click here : [Surefire Report](https://github.com/AntoineChvl/JPU-BlankProject/blob/controller/target/site/surefire-report.html)

## Built With :

* [PhpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) – MySQL Database
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management / Javadoc
* [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4/) – Unit testing
* [Eclipse]( https://www.eclipse.org/) – Java IDE

## Versioning :

-	Eclipse : 2019-03 (4.11.0)
-	Github desktop : 1.6.6
-	Visual Paradigm : 15.2 (Build 20190201)
-	Gantt Project : 2.6.6

## Project review by authors :

In the words of Maxence BONNEAU
>	During this project, I have work on the code and the diagrams that we had to do. Even if I'm not very good at java, I tried to code better for my group, but I did as much as possible to advance on the project.

In the words of Tanguy LHINARES
> This project was a really good one because even if I wasn’t really good in java at the beginning I’ve become better through practice and despite some first difficulties to make the link between github and eclipse and some **commit and push** conflicts we always found solutions and now we finished this project and I’m glad to present it on 4th of june

In the words of Vincent JACQUES
> All along the project, I worked on the map's creation, packages diagram, and a little bit on Java. I just wish I  could worked more on Java coding cause that was the most interesting part.

In the words of Antoine CHAUVEL
> With a strong technical background, this fifth project has been one of the most enriching yet. I truly appreciated to work on a concrete subject as this game was, in order to improve my Java knowledge during the last couple of weeks. By being the project manager, I had to organize meetings with the group, making sure each one will work effectively in order to respect the due date. The only drawback of this project is that deep level disparities have not allowed an equal distribution of workload.
